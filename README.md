# amibi-greed
A simulation of how greedy and sharing organisms coexist.

# Details
There will two types of amibi: greedy and sharing, determined by their genetics. The grass has level 0.0 - 1.0, with each grass growing by 0.1 each time-step. Only grass at level 1.0 is fit for eating. The greedy amibi eat the grass upto level 0.0, while the sharing ones eat it upto 0.5. Thus, the greedy ensure their own survival by eating more, while the sharing ones eat less so that the grass can regrow quickly and be available to all. We are to see which strategy turns out to be better in terms of survival. Amibi reproduce by eating and die of hunger.
